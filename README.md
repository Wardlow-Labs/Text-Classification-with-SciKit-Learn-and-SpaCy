# Text-Classification-with-SciKit-Learn-and-SpaCy
 
This project executes the following tasks:
* Read in a collection of documents - a *corpus*
* Transform text into numerical vector data using a pipeline
* Create a classifier
* Fit/train the classifier
* Test the classifier on new data
* Evaluate performance

We use the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ in order to develop a classification model which aims to predict the Positive/Negative labels based on text content alone.
